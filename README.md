# rbw-practice-map
This is my biggest project (probably a fail).
I dont know what Iam doing, this is my first time using github, and uploading a trash map.

Hello, Im koala, and this is my test beta version of my new map, the Ranked Bedwars Practice map.

This map includes:
 - Blockin Practice (You can change your layout and customize the bed defense)
 - Bed Defense Practice (Here you are gonna practice defending your bed soon as possible, with a snowball reset)
 - Bridge Practice (You can change the distance from between islands: 25 - 50 - 100 - 140 and diagnol, with the same distances)
 - Hotkey Practice (Just, practice your hotkeys)

Others:
 - Parkour courses (For movement Practice)
 - Mlg (ladders, bucket, and block clutches)
 - Clutch Practice (Top fight clutch situations, and normal clutches which you can see in everyhere)

Note:
In this beta version, this map just include the Blockin Practice, in future versions Im gonna add all this courses :)
Open an issue, if you are having issues with my map or want to give me some feedback and ideias :)))
